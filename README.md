# Search-Engine
Creating a Search engine using Boolean model and Ranked Retrieval to search word or phrase from the files(pdf,text,word etc) in the system (of the user) that are readable.
We created this program using python programming language.
Our Program uses Boolean search for a single word or a Boolean query.
Ranked Retrieval for phrase query or sentence.
This Search Engine is able to distinguish between Boolean query and Pharase query.
If we type a single word or a boolean query format a list containing name of file will be printed.
If we type a phrase a list of file will be printed according to score(in decreasing order of the score)
Here, we have used NLTK library function.
